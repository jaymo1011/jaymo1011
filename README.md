# Hi there, I'm Jaymo
I've been programming as a hobby for over a decade, and I'm currently employed doing... *a little bit of everything*.

Most of my programming experience has been in Lua as an extension language for various video games, but I've also dabbled in **many** other programming languages.
If you can think of it, I've either already used it or could learn it in a few days.

Hope you have a good day!
