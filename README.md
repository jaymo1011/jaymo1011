# Hi there, I'm Jaymo
I've been coding as a hobby for years now. I love it and it my dream to find a job in the industry.<br><sub>and also finish the infinite backlog of projects I have ðŸ˜…</sub>

Currently, I create content for and contribute to the [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) project (although I haven't yet committed to the main repo ðŸ˜³) as well help the people over at [@CitizenFX](https://github.com/citizenfx) with some moderation tasks.

Most of my coding experience has been in Lua as an extension language for various video games but I've also dabbled in:
- ActionScript 2.0
- AutoHotkey (eek)
- C
- C++
- C#
- Java
- JavaScript (including all your *favourite* web frameworks such as React and Angular)
- Perl
- PHP
- Visual Basic
- VBScript (gotta love MsgBox)

and, of course, the two **not** languages people still consider to be languages:
- HTML
- CSS (and it's higher level forms)

Hope you have a good day!
